This repo contains part of the content of the course **Introduction to Computational Thinking - Spring 2021**, as made available [on this site](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/).

Following files and folders have been copied from the course's [GH repo.](https://github.com/mitmath/18S191) and left unchanged:

All my changes are made either on copies of the files above or in new files, which I have authored.
