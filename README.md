This repo contains part of the content of the course **Introduction to Computational Thinking - Spring 2021**, as made available [on this site](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/).

Following files and folders have been copied from the course's [GH repo.](https://github.com/mitmath/18S191):

These may contain changes made by me, as I went through them and tried to assimilate their content.

All the other files and folders, if not otherwise specified, have been created by myself.
